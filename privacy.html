    <h1>Privacy Policy for RunCall</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 27, 2026</p>
    <p>RunCall uses your Google Calendar data for one purpose only: to help you manage your availability for consultation sessions.</p>
    <h2>Data Access</h2>
    <p>We access your Google Calendar to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read your events to identify busy slots (so clients can't book you when you are busy).</li>
        <li>Create new events when a client books a session.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>We do not store your calendar details on our servers. We only store the "RunCall" appointments created through our platform.</p>
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transfer your Google user data to any third-party AI tools or advertisers.</p>
